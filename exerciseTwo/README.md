Exercise [Two](https://gophercises.com/exercises/urlshort){:target="_blank"} on Gophercises.com

Using the program:

Run the main go file (go build && ./exerciseTwo or go run main.go), and navigate to localhost:8080/
You should see 'Hello, World'
You can then test the paths specified in 'pathsToUrls' and 'yaml' and see the webpage redirect to the the URLs the paths are mapped to.

i.e. localhost:8080/urlshort -> should take you to github.com/gophercises/urlshort
